# ResearchEffort

Controls how much time and effort the Research API spends on your question. Higher effort levels run more searches and dig deeper into sources, at the cost of a longer response time.

Available levels:
- `lite`: Returns answers quickly. Good for straightforward questions that just need a fast, reliable answer.
- `standard`: The default. Balances speed and depth, a good fit for most questions.
- `deep`: Spends more time researching and cross-referencing sources. Use this when accuracy and thoroughness matter more than speed.
- `exhaustive`: The most thorough option. Explores the topic as fully as possible, best suited for complex research tasks where you want the highest quality result.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { ResearchEffort } from "@youdotcom-oss/sdk/models/operations";

let value: ResearchEffort = "lite";
```

## Values

```typescript
"lite" | "standard" | "deep" | "exhaustive"
```
