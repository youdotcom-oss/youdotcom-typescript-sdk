                Execute queries using You.com's AI agents. This endpoint supports three agent types:

                - **Express Agent**: Fast responses with optional web search (max 1 search)
                - **Advanced Agent**: Complex queries with multi-turn reasoning, planning, and tool usage
                - **Custom Agent**: User-configured assistants created in the You.com UI

                The response format depends on the `stream` parameter - either a complete JSON payload or Server-Sent Events (SSE).
